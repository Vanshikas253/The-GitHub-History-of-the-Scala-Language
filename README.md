# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language
Finding the true Scala experts by exploring its development history in Git and GitHub.


##Project Description
Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this DataCamp project, I wrote the code to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. 

The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
